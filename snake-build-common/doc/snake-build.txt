Snake Build

v0.1, June 2010: Document Started

Snake Build was started to get an easy to use Continuous Integration server for
embedded projects. There are several Ci solutions availabel but most of them
are build for Java or .NET and not for embedded targets or other C++ builds.
Most of them allow building nativ aplications but this is usally rather clumbsy
or difficult to use.

There are other solutions that work rather well with C/C++ or embedded targets
but they are not very intuitive and therefore hard to get started.

The goal of this project is to provide a build server which is easy to set up,
configure and to use.
