Snake Build

v0.1, February 2012: Document Started

Snake Build was started to get an easy to use Continuous Integration server for
embedded projects. There are several Ci solutions available but most of them
are build for either Java or .NET and not for embedded targets or other C/C++
builds.
Most of them allow building C/C++ applications but this is usually rather clumsy
or difficult to use.

There are other solutions that work rather well with C/C++ or embedded targets
but they are not very intuitive and therefore hard to get started.

The goal of this project is to provide a build server which is easy to set up,
configure and to use.
