Snake Build
-----------

Snake Build has the goal to provide a build server for C/C++ projects including
embedded projects. It should not be limited to C/C++ but this should be the
main focus.

The main difference between this Build server and the other build servers is
that all the configuration and build instructions for a project should be
stored within a version control system. This could be http://git-scm.com/[GIT]
or http://mercurial.selenic.com/[Mercurial] but should not be limited to those.

The build server it self should consists out of several seperated modules. By 
dividing it into several seperate applications it is possible to have this 
modules running on seperate servers which helps to reduce the load and should
get a better scalabilety since not everything depends on a single instance.
