== Status

=== Current State

v0.1;;
  This version provides a first implementation of the resource server and the
  resource client. This two components can be used to access resources from an
  existing build server. For example if you have external testing resources
  which can't be managed by the build server you are using then this might
  already be usable.
  There is currently no support for building software and the configuration
  files are not yet stored within a a VCS.

=== Future Roadmap

v0.2;;
  This version should provide the possibility to build software with simple
  build scripts.

v0.3;;
  This version should provide support for getting all the build scripts and the
  config files from a VCS.

v0.x;;
  Get the control an reporting server. This includes a web frontend. A more
  detailed plan will be made after further progress.

v1.0;;
  Everything is working....
